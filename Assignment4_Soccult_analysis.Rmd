## We write a function to load all the data and do the necessary cleaning:

```{r}

  # load data
  data <- read.csv(file = filename)
  
  # create empty filename column

  # put the filenames into this column

  # remove the whole path so only the actual filename is left

                        "", data$filename)
  
  # with mutate
  # create trial column by extracting the trial number from the filename (the filename col will be used as iteration col)
  data <- data %>% 
    mutate(
      trial = str_extract(filename, regex("l\\d+")), # getting any number of digits after "l"
      trial = as.numeric(gsub("l", "", trial)),      # removing "l" from the values in the trial col
      
      # Prolong the columns that only have a datapoint in the first row
      wealth_slider = data[1,13],
      weight_mean = data[1,14],
      initial_price = data[1,15],
      own_assessment_sd = data[1,16],

      weight_sd = data[1,18],
      initial_n_selling = data[1,19],
      initial_n_buying = data[1,20]
    ) %>%
  
  # Rename x and y columns to what they actually are (x cols are ticks, y cols are CP, n_selling, n_buying)
  # I guess the 2nd and 3rd x column are redundant

# Create a list with all the data:

# Let's try out the function:

#testlist <- list[1:4]

#stock_data <- testlist %>% 
#  purrr::map_df(read_stock)

# Looks like it's working. Nice!



# Reading all the data:
stock_data <- list %>% 
  purrr::map_df(read_stock)

# Create a W2 column
stock_data <- stock_data %>% 
  mutate(
    W2 = 1 - weight_mean

Test chunk for testing functions for the read_stock function and identifying bad files:

```{r}
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/andre/OneDrive - Aarhus universitet/Cognitive Science/Social and Cultural Dynamics/Exam/Data/trial1iteration0.723053789848823.csv")




# Prolonging columns can be done like so:
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    wealth_slider = df[1,13],
    weight_mean = df[1,14],
    initial_price = df[1,15]
  )


# Filename column is created like so:
df$filename <- ""
df$filename <- "C:/Users/andre/OneDrive - Aarhus universitet/Cognitive Science/Social and Cultural Dynamics/Exam/Data/trial1iteration0.723053789848823.csv"

# And the path is removed from the name like so:
df$filename <- gsub("C:/Users/andre/OneDrive - Aarhus universitet/Cognitive Science/Social and Cultural Dynamics/Exam/Data/", "", df$filename)

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    trial = str_extract(df$filename, regex("l\\d+")), # getting any number of digits after l
    iteration = str_extract(df$filename, regex("n\\d+")) #This does not work, so we ust use the filename col as the iteration col
  )


# Trying to de-select some columns:
df <- df %>% 
  select(
    -x.2,
    -color,
    -color.1
  )





# A for loop for identifying files with error in them:
for(i in list) {
  i <- read_stock(i)
}

print(list)
